  <p style="text-align:center; font-size:x-large; color:aliceblue;"> Hello !!! 
  First I would like to thank you for visiting my page. I am Yasmine Toure, I am from Ivory Coast (West Africa), and I am a student at the George Washington University. My major is Business with a concentration in International Business.
I started working out as a junior in college and realized that working out was for me an energy and mood booster. It is also a stress relief and it helps me organizing my work and life better.


I know that working out is not easy for everybody, especially women since they have a lotof duties (work, education, childcare). Sometimes, some women do not know where and how to start working out so I created this website to help them and 
encourage them in started their workout journey with structured workout plans, meals, and tips! </p>
